    <h2>Kenya</h2>

    <p>
        Beach tourism, eco-tourism, cultural tourism, and sports tourism are all part of the tourism sector in Kenya.[4]
        During the 1990s, the number of tourists travelling to Kenya decreased, partly due to the well-publicised
        murders of several tourists.[5] However, tourism in Kenya is one of the leading sources of foreign exchange
        along with coffee.

    <h3>Malawi</h3>

    <p>
        Although Malawi is a small country relative to African standards, this is often its appeal as it welcomes those
        looking for a relaxing holiday in a beautifully unspoilt part of the world. It is well-known for its smiling,
        friendly people. Most importantly, it is known for its extraordinary freshwater lake, Lake Malawi, which
        dominates this landlocked country. The clear waters and tranquil islands provide the perfect, laid-back beach
        holiday; whilst Malawiâ€™s 11 national parks and wildlife reserves offer activities like hiking, mountain biking
        and birdwatching.

        aside in protected areas for conservation.[1] There are 17 national parks,[2] 29 game reserves, 40 controlled
        conservation areas (including the Ngorongoro Conservation Area) and marine parks. Tanzania is also home to Mount
        Kilimanjaro, the highest point in Africa.

        Tourism in Zanzibar includes the tourism industry and its effects on the islands of Unguja (known
        internationally as Zanzibar) and Pemba in the United Republic of Tanzania. ... The main airport on the island is
        Zanzibar International Airport, though many tourists fly into Dar es Salaam and take a ferry to the island.
